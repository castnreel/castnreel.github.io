            <br><br> <p>this was the first time that the robot was functional after the code was uploaded which will be shown next but the reason this photo is first is becasue of the v4 cortex on the bot this is the next step <br>
            the code is implanted inside of the cortex and it is the thing that connects to a controller to make it so as driving the bot possible</p>
